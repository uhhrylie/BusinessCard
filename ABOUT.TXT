Create a business card for yourself -- it can be for your current self w/ a real occupation, or for an imagined future version of yourself when you have your dream job.

Your card will need beautiful alignment, custom fonts, and an image of some type (logo, photo, etc). Honors students will need to complete two separate designs with significantly different styles (for example, landscape and portrait).

We will build the card one piece at a time in class over the next week. Look for YouTube tutorials & lessons to help in class and on our google classroom.
