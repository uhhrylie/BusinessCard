# Instructions  

Create a business card for yourself -- it can be for your current self w/ a real occupation, or for an imagined future version of yourself when you have your dream job.

Your card will need beautiful alignment, custom fonts, and an image of some type (logo, photo, etc).

Honors students will need to complete two separate designs with significantly different styles (for example, landscape and portrait, or dark mode and light mode).
Honors students: create two separate designs with a significant difference between them. Suggestions for differences include:
- Landscape vs. Portait orientation
- Monotone vs. Full Color
- Two different approaches to layout
- If you're stuck, show me your first design and I'm happy to make suggestions for a second, different approach :)

## Steps:

1. Draw a card on paper, or using another tool.
2. Think about how to break down your design into sections using flexbox. [Breaking down a card into HTML sections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3axgQA33G5c)
3. Make sure you understand flexbox. [Flexbox video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRsgGZA6dyM). [Flexbox textbook](https://trinket.io/thinkle_innovationcharter_org/courses/intro-to-html#/basic-layout-with-flexbox/boxes-boxes-boxes)

5. Customize the font [Video walkthrough of fonts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsapLwqVKsQ)
6. Use images [Example of using background images in css](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YJl5RaIpO4)

You might have fun using some Adobe tools for this project. Adobe has templates, stock images, backgrounds, and more at [Adobe Express](https://new.express.adobe.com)

The chrome inspector is *very helpful* for troubleshooting flexblock layouts and even creating them. [See this video on how to use it](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/flexbox/)

Note: I built this [flexbox code generator](https://flexbox-codegen.netlify.app/) last year to help students -- you may find it helpful or not, depending -- sometimes it's easier to just work on your own, but it does give you a nice visual interface.
